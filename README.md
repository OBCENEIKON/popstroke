# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version
3.2.0

* System dependencies
Bundler
npm
Rails
yarn
foreman

* Database creation
`rails db:create`

* Database initialization
`rails db:migrate`

* Instructions
After cloning this repository and switching to the directory it was cloned into, run the following:
```
bundle install
yarn install
rails db:create db:migrate
bin/dev
```

Now open http://localhost:3000 in a browser.

* Notes: There is a lot of room for improvement especially considering that my React isn't my strongest language. Rails validation errors aren't reflected in the frontend either, ran out of time.
